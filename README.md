# Aspire4Wasm.Samples.Standalone.Mud

Demonstrates how Aspire4Wasm makes .NET Aspire work with stand-alone Blazor WebAssembly apps with a MudBlazor UI.
If you're more interested in hosted Blazor WebAssembly apps, there's a sample for that at: https://github.com/BenjaminCharlton/Aspire4Wasm.Samples.Hosted
If you like this but want the regular Bootstrap UI, there's a sample at: https://github.com/BenjaminCharlton/Aspire4Wasm.Samples.Standalone
